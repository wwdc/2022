    <p> My name is Joep Hinderink and I live in The Netherlands. For the Swift Student Challenge 2022 I submitted Binamicle and it got accepted.</p>
    <p> Down below you will find other submissions for the Swift Student Challenge 2022." </p>
    <p>My app, Binamicle, translates text to a binary numeral system captured from:</p>
      <ul>
  <li>Images</li>
  <li>Speech</li>
  <li>Typinh</li>
</ul>
       <p>You first enter an onboarding screen after which you have to follow all the steps. Finishing all these steps will lead you to a home screen where you can try everything again. </p>
